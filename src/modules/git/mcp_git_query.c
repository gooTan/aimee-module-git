 * kinds that omitted `mirror`, and the cwd was prefix-matched against the
 * registered root — which for a mirror workspace is the CLIENT's path, a
 * directory that does not exist on this server, while git runs in a
 * reconstruction elsewhere. Both said "not ours" about a live checkout, so the
 * credential below was never injected and git ran bare: "could not read
 * Username", indistinguishable from a dead token, while reads kept working
 * because git_pr_api.c never execs git.
 *
