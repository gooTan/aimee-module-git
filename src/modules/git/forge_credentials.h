/* forge_credentials — the per-workspace short-lived forge-token broker
 * (workspace-resource-plane §4). The ONLY path by which a detached aimee-server
 * gets push/PR rights: a filesystem-rich client hands a short-lived, narrowly
 * scoped forge token (a GitHub/GitLab App installation token, a fine-grained
 * PAT, or `gh auth token`) over the authenticated /v1 channel; the server holds
 * it for the lifetime of the workspace and injects it into the git/gh exec
 * environment (GH_TOKEN + a GIT_ASKPASS shim that echoes it).
 *
 * Invariant: the token lives IN MEMORY ONLY — never written to disk, never
 * logged — and its buffer is explicitly zeroed on revoke / session close.
 *
 * This is deliberately distinct from:
 *   - delegate_credentials.c — leases *LLM-provider API keys* per agent.
 *   - the distributed-mode-auth bearer/mTLS — authenticates the
 *     client<->server / server<->kb channel, not the server<->forge channel.
 *
 * The broker is process-global and thread-safe. Time is passed in (now_epoch)
 * so the core is pure/testable; callers pass time(NULL). */

 * "workspace", "project", "user" — the charter scope lattice), valid for
 * `ttl_seconds` from `now_epoch`. Replaces (zeroing) any existing token for the
 * workspace. The token is copied into a broker-owned heap buffer; the caller
 * should wipe its own copy after. Returns 0, or -1 on bad args / registry full. */
